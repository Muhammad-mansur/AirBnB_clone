AirBnB Clone - Console Command Interpreter

In this project, We are building a clone of the popular platform, AirBnB. Our goal is to create a command-line interface (CLI) that will serve as a command interpreter for managing objects and their abstraction, as well as handling their storage.

Features of the Console:

Creating New Objects
Retrieving Objects from Files
Performing Operations on Objects
Destroying Objects

Storage:

To manage the classes and their data storage, we will use the Storage engine. The engine will utilize the FileStorage class, which will handle reading and writing objects to and from files on the system.
